The application is an assistant to be consulted daily by users experiencing cognitive fatigue. Here is an overview of the main features of this application.

The user has reports to fill out, where they evaluate their feelings throughout the day. Therefore, there is a report to be completed every day by the end of the day, available until noon the next day.

The user has selected goals when creating their account. These goals will be used to create a personalized "For You" article list. The user can validate achievements when they complete certain tasks to motivate themselves. For example, filling out all the daily reports for a week without missing one.

If the user experiences symptoms but is unsure if they could be related to cognitive fatigue, they can perform a quick analysis by selecting the experienced symptoms. A brief report is then generated, providing a percentage and suggesting relevant articles based on those symptoms.

The user can access and modify their personal profile, which serves as a means for them to store useful data for visits to healthcare professionals, for example.

The user has a recommended article list based on their selected goals during account creation. Additionally, there is a separate list with the most recent articles available. These articles aim to educate the user about cognitive fatigue and help them better understand their symptoms.

The user has a calendar that contains all the daily reports, weekly reports, achieved goals, messages received from a tutor (if applicable).

The user receives notifications when:
- A daily report is available
- A weekly report is available
- A goal is achieved
- A message from the tutor arrives
- A suggested article is added to the list
- A medication from the consumption list needs to be taken.
